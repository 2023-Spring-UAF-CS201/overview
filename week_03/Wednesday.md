## Introduction

* Review answers to Lab 02
* Provide overview of what will be covered today

### Brief review of core C++ types (< 5 minutes)

* Types:
  - Primitive types
    * int
    * double
    * bool
    * char
  - Complex types
    * string
    * vector

### Brief review of core C++ operators (< 5 minutes)

* Operations
  - `+`
    * addition (for int and double)
    * concatenation (for strings)
  - `-`
    * minus (for int and double)
  - `*`
    * times (for int and double)
  - `\`
    * integer division (for int)
    * floating point division (for double)
  - `%`
    * modulo (for int - also known as remainder)

### Brief review of core libraries (< 5 minutes)

* Important libraries
  - `#include <iostream>`
    * `std::cout`
    * `std::cin`
  - `#include <string>`
    * `std::string`
  - `#include <vector>`
    * `std::vector`

* Other libraries
  - `#include <cmath>`
    * `sqrt()`



## Chapter 3 (new topics)

* How to [declare a variable](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/initialization) with a type in C++
  - Value initialization
    * `int x{7};`
    * `string greeting{"Hello"};`
  - Copy initialization
    * `string t = "Hello";`


* Input and prompts with `cin` and `cout`


## Chapter 3 (new topics if time permits)

* Safe and unsafe conversion of numeric types (ยง3.9 Type safety)

* Using cin as the condition of a while loop



## HW01

Reminder of Part D due date on Friday

If time permits, present the other 3 parts (C, B, and A)




## Lab 03

* Assign Lab 03 (reading a string using cin)
